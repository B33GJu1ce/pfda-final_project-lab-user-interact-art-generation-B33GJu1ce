# User Interaction-Art Generation

## Repository
<(https://github.com/B33GJu1ce/pfda-final_project-lab-user-interact-art-generation-B33GJu1ce.git)>

## Description
In this lab, we will focus in creating unique pieces of art through user interaction. Allowing users to manipulate various parameters to create visually interesting patterns, colors, and shapes.
## Features
- Feature 1
	- User interface for adjusting parameters such as color, shape, size, and complexity.
- Feature 2
	- Visualization of the generated artwork.
- Feature 3 
	- Option to save or export the artwork in different formats.

## Challenges
Implementing elements using Pygame by generating patterns algorithmically.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A functional interactive art generator with controls and visual results.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Basic functionality; allowing users adjust parameters and generate art.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  Set up project repository, research algorithms for generating patterns.

- Week 2
  Implement basic user interface and parameter controls.

- Week N (Final)
  Develop algorithms for generating art based on user input.
  Finalize user interface, add exporting functionality, and test the program.
